# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This project currently contains a single file: `index.html`. It appears to be the starting point for a web-based application, but the file is incomplete and does not provide further architectural or workflow context.

## Key Files and Structure
- `index.html`: The main (and only) file in the project. This is the entry point for the application.
- No build scripts, package managers, or additional documentation are present.
- No README or workflow documentation exists yet.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- **Assume a blank-slate HTML/JS/CSS project.** There are no frameworks, build tools, or conventions established yet.
- **All new code should be added to `index.html`** unless additional files are explicitly requested or created.
- **Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for any new features unless the user requests otherwise.
- **No external dependencies or integrations** are currently present. If you need to add any, document them clearly in comments and suggest updating this file.
- **No testing, build, or deployment workflows** are defined. If you add any, document the commands and update this file.

## Example Patterns
- Place all scripts and styles inline within `index.html` unless otherwise instructed.
- Use semantic HTML structure and modern best practices.

## Next Steps
- If the project grows, update this file to document new conventions, workflows, or architectural decisions.
- If you add a README or other documentation, reference it here.
